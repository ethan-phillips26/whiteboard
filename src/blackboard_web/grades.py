"""Weighted grade math.

Blackboard supplies the structure — categories, columns, points, and your
scores — but not how the categories are weighted; that lives in the syllabus.
These functions take both and answer the two questions worth asking: where do I
stand, and what do I need on this next thing.

Everything here is pure: plain dicts in, plain dicts out, no I/O.
